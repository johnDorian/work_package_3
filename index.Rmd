## Using isotopic and geochemical tracers to identify sources of runoff

<b>Aims and objectives</b>

1. Identify the main sources of water at the catchment scale.
2. Use this information to improve the understanding of the sources and fate of C through the catchment.

<b>How we will use the data</b>

- <span class='red'>Precipitation samples</span>: Identify the isotopic signature of precipitation inputs
- <span class='red'>Soil water</span>: Identify isotopic signature to monitor mixing of soil water and precipitation and the travel time from soil to the stream.
- <span class='red'>Stream sampling (catchment outlet)</span>: Detect seasonal trends and allow for the calibration of estimated transit times.

## Data summary ##

Data           | Frequency | Objective
---------------|-----------|----------
Synoptic sampling | multiple times throughout 13 and 14 | Examine small scales controls
Extra synoptic sites | 2 visits (2014) |  Incorporated into a network geospatial model
Stream discharge  | (15 min - 2014) | Estimating loads and hydrological modeling
Soil water | multiple times at 2 depths (4 locations) during 2014 | Used in estimating transit times and identifying production and sources of DOC
Rainfall collection | throughout 2013 and 2014 | Used as input to transit time modeling
CDOM | (2 weeks during 2014) | Continuous estimates of DOC

## Hydrological time series##
```{r, echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE,message=FALSE, fig.width=13, fig.height=9}
library(ggplot2)
library(gridExtra)
load("wp3_plots.rdat")
time_series
```

## Isotope overview ##
```{r, echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE,message=FALSE, fig.width=11, fig.height=6}
load("wp3_plots.rdat")
iso_2_years
```

> A strong seasonal variation can be seen in the isotopes. 

> The sources of water (rain, snow and soil water) have distinct signals

---
## Temporal isotope data ##
```{r, echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE,message=FALSE, fig.width=11, fig.height=8}
load("wp3_plots.rdat")
iso_time_series
```



---
## Soil water Isotopes##
```{r, echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE,message=FALSE, fig.width=6, fig.height=6}
load("wp3_plots.rdat")
soil_water_plot
```
> There is a large variation between the two slopes

> This may be useful for identify and tracing carbon in the system



---
## CDOM data ##
```{r, echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE,message=FALSE, fig.width=11, fig.height=6}
load("wp3_plots.rdat")
cdom_plot
```

> CDOM is a good surrogate for DOC.
> There is large daily diurnal variation.

> The rainfall event had a dilution effect on DOC.

## Soil pH data ##

```{r, echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE,message=FALSE, fig.width=10, fig.height=5}
load("wp3_plots.rdat")
soil_ph_plot
```

> Soil pH data collected at 14C profile sites. 

> Willow sites differ greatly from the other sites.

> Additional samples were collected along transect 2.

## WP3 Summary ##

<b> Interesting findings so far</b>
> The isotope data looks promising to inform how C is transported through the catchment.

> Strongly controlled by active layer dynamics. 

> Isotopes will be used to inform the hydrological model of the catchment.

<b> Paper Ideas </b>

> Linking soil dissolved carbon with stable isotopes to identify sources in Siksik

## Aims and objectives ##

<br></br>
1. Develop a parsimonious hydrological model for an Arctic catchment using hydrological tracers to improve model structure. 

2. Use isotope data to estimate transit times in the catchment. 

3. Improved hydrology and freeze/thaw routines for ECOSSE and improved DOC estimates for parsimonious hydrological model. 

<b>Tasks completed</b>
- Developed a coupled hydrology-biogeochemistry model to simulate stream discharge and DOC for Granger catchment.

## Coupled model##

<b>Hydrological component</b>
- Based on the conceptual HBV model.
- Includes an additional modules:
    - for the affect of slope facing aspects, and
    - freeze-thaw processes do to soil frost and permafrost conditions

<b> DOC component</b>
- Based on the DOC components of the ECOSSE model
- Simplified DOC production and loss functions using 
  - a Q10 relationship for temperature, and 
  - a soil moisture modifying term.

## Observed data from Granger catchment ##

```{r, echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE,message=FALSE, fig.width=11, fig.height=6}
load("plots_for_talk.rdata")
obs_plot
```

> Subarctic alpine catchment with permafrost on north facing slopes.

> Characterised with large spring melt stream discharge events early spring.

---

##  Stream discharge simulations ##

```{r,echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.width=11, fig.height=6}
load("plots_for_talk.rdata")
q_val_plot
```

> Discharge simulations captured the spring melt timing and magnitude for most years.

> Simulated discharge is strongly correlated <span class = 'red'>($r^2=0.67$)</span> with observed discharge.


---

##  DOC simulations ##

```{r, echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE,message=FALSE, fig.width=11, fig.height=6}
load("plots_for_talk.rdata")
doc_val_plot
```

> DOC simulations captured the spring melt timing and magnitude for most years with a strong correlation to the observed DOC <span class = 'red'>($r^2=0.81$)</span>.

> The simulations also indicate that DOC concentrations increase later in the season.


---

## Coupled Simulations ##

```{r ,echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE,message=FALSE, fig.width=15, fig.height=7}
load("plots_for_talk.rdata")
year_2008_plot
```

> Simulations closely resemble observed trends of both DOC and stream discharge.



---

## Simulated soil water DOC ##

```{r, echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE,message=FALSE, fig.width=10, fig.height=6}
load("plots_for_talk.rdata")
sw_plot
```

> Soil water DOC works well for the south facing slope, but is exported a little quickly on the north facing slope.

##  Observed DOC v simulated DOC ##

```{r, echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE,message=FALSE, fig.width=10, fig.height=6}

## Transit time modeling ##

```{r, echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE,message=FALSE, fig.width=10, fig.height=6}
load("wp3_plots.rdat")

```

> Transit times are based on the _smoothing_ of the isotope signal by the catchment
