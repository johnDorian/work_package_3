## Using isotopic and geochemical tracers to identify sources of runoff

<b>Aims and objectives</b>

1. Identify the main sources of water at the catchment scale.
2. Use this information to improve the understanding of the sources and fate of C through the catchment.

<b>How we will use the data</b>

- <span class='red'>Precipitation samples</span>: Identify the isotopic signature of precipitation inputs
- <span class='red'>Soil water</span>: Identify isotopic signature to monitor mixing of soil water and precipitation and the travel time from soil to the stream.
- <span class='red'>Stream sampling (catchment outlet)</span>: Detect seasonal trends and allow for the calibration of estimated transit times.

## Data summary ##

Data           | Frequency | Objective
---------------|-----------|----------
Synoptic sampling | multiple times throughout 13 and 14 | Examine small scales controls
Extra synoptic sites | 2 visits (2014) |  Incorporated into a network geospatial model
Stream discharge  | (15 min - 2014) | Estimating loads and hydrological modelling
Soil water | multiple times at 2 depths (4 locations) during 2014 | Used in estimating transit times and identifying production and sources of DOC
Rainfall collection | throughout 2013 and 2014 | Used as input to transit time modelling
CDOM | (2 weeks during 2014) | Continuous estimates of DOC
