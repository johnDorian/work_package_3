## Aquatic transport: Tracing the terrestrial–aquatic C flow in arctic hydrological systems

<b>Tasks I:</b>
> - <span class = 'red'>Use isotopic and geochemical tracers to identify sources of runoff</span>, their temporal dynamics and landscape controls at multiple spatial scales (precipitation collectors, grab sampling of streamwater and synoptic sampling)
 
> - <span class = 'red'>Identify differences in source / age of aquatic C (POC, DOC, CO2 and CH4) using $\delta$13C and 14C</span> in areas with and without permafrost,  linking these differences to changes in <span class = 'red'>hydrological functioning and the soil C pool</span> (passive/composite and instantaneous isotopic sampling methods for the determination of $\delta$13C and 14C)

> - To develop empirically-informed conceptual understanding of arctic hydrological systems to address hypotheses / questions in <b>WPs 1-2</b>; 

> - <span class = 'red'>To develop a tracer-based empirical understanding</span> of catchment function to <span class = 'red'>inform and constrain low-parameter hydrological models</span> in <b>WP4</b>.

## Aquatic transport: Tracing the terrestrial–aquatic C flow in arctic hydrological systems (cont.)

> The fate of DOC within the aquatic system and potential for further downstream CO2/CH4 release will be quantified using two approaches; (1) in situ DOC field degradation experiments, where reactor vessels containing ‘source area DOC’ will be deployed at contrasting points in the river system and changes in headspace CO2 and CH4 concentration measured over time, and (2) synoptic downstream C flux measurements of C species using a mass balance approach in streams of increasing size to show net loss/gain of C (using Cl as a natural, conservative tracer to control the effect of net losses/gain of water from the aquatic system18).
