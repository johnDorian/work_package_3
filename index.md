## Aquatic transport: Tracing the terrestrial–aquatic C flow in arctic hydrological systems

<b>Tasks I:</b>
> - <span class = 'red'>Use isotopic and geochemical tracers to identify sources of runoff</span>, their temporal dynamics and landscape controls at multiple spatial scales (precipitation collectors, grab sampling of streamwater and synoptic sampling)
 
> - <span class = 'red'>Identify differences in source / age of aquatic C (POC, DOC, CO2 and CH4) using $\delta$13C and 14C</span> in areas with and without permafrost,  linking these differences to changes in <span class = 'red'>hydrological functioning and the soil C pool</span> (passive/composite and instantaneous isotopic sampling methods for the determination of $\delta$13C and 14C)

> - To develop empirically-informed conceptual understanding of arctic hydrological systems to address hypotheses / questions in <b>WPs 1-2</b>; 

> - <span class = 'red'>To develop a tracer-based empirical understanding</span> of catchment function to <span class = 'red'>inform and constrain low-parameter hydrological models</span> in <b>WP4</b>.
